ETLs for the Investment Analysis platform

This server was built using Python 3.11.11

In case of the venv not activating automatically, use the command `source .venv/bin/activate`

To run the ETL and load new data into the database, you must create a ./data/set_env.py file based on the ./data/set_env.py.example file

To run the code, execute the data/etl/script.py file using the Python debugger of VS Code
